### üëã Hi, I'm Fran√ßois Garillot.

I work at the intersection of research and engineering, currently focused on advancing zero-knowledge proofs and their applications in blockchain technology.

- üìñ I co-wrote a book on Streaming with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) ([the book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/stream-processing-with/9781491944233/), [the code examples repository](https://github.com/stream-processing-with-spark)).
- In 2021, I completed a Coq proof of the LibraBFT consensus algorithm safety ([proof](http://github.com/novifinancial/librachain), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgh_b7j4ITI), [slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgh_b7j4IT)).
- üî¨ I worked on [Lurk, a Lisp-based language for recursive zkSNARKs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0paenVUF74).
- üåê Exploring new paradigms for blockchain security through proof aggregation.

Previously, I worked at at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), [Novi](https://novi.com/) and [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/).
